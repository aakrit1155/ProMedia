Django music streaming web app
This is a project I created inspired from TheNewBoston's Bucky. 
This project uses django as a backend and html, css, and JS as the frontend.
You can create an account to become a user. The users have the facilities to create albums, and add music to the albums.
The users can also mark their favorite songs and access them quicly from the favorites tab.
